Despite the name, the contents of this repo is publicly visible!

It mirrors the production 'private' repo (which really is private) and
provides dummy passwords for puppet compatibility.

It consists of:

- Stub files and classes needed to satisfy puppet dependencies
- Dummy passwords for same
- Certs that are self-signed and therefore certify nothing
- A few keys and passwords that are 'real' in the sense that labs
  instances need them to communicate with upstream services.

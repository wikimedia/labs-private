Despite the name, the contents of this repo is visible to all Labs account holders.

It consists of:

- Stub files and classes needed to satisfy puppet dependencies
- Dummy passwords for same
- Certs that are self-signed and therefore certify nothing
- A few keys and passwords that are 'real' in the sense that labs instances
  need them to communicate with upstream services.

The live keys and passwords are not secure, but they are moderately obscure.  For that reason, please do not share the contents of this repo outside of Labs.

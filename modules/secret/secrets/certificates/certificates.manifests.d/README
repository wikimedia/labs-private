This directory contains cergen certificate manifest files.
The files here declare certificates and keys to be generated,
as well as the CAs that will be used to sign certificates.

To generate these, use the cergen CLI like:

cergen --base-path /srv/private/modules/secret/secrets/certificates --generate
  /srv/private/modules/secret/secrets/certificates/certificate.manifests.d

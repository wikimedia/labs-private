This directory contains cergen certificate manifest files.
The files here declare certificates and keys to be generated,
as well as the CAs that will be used to sign certificates.

To generate these, use the cergen CLI like:

  cergen --base-path /srv/private/modules/secret/secrets/certificates --generate \
  /srv/private/modules/secret/secrets/certificates/certificates.manifests.d


deployment-prep certificates are signed by the deployment-prep puppetmaster.
To generate these, log into the deployment-prep puppetmaster and run:

  KEYTOOL_BIN=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/keytool cergen --base-path /tmp/certificates --generate \
  /var/lib/git/labs/private/modules/secret/secrets/certificates/certificates.manifests.d

(NOTE: Java 7's keytool does not work with EC keys, so we set KEYTOOL_BIN to Java 8's.
This is necessary while puppetmaster is still jessie with default JRE as Java 7.)

Then rsync the /tmp/certificates directory down into your local working copy of labs-private:

  rsync -av deployment-puppetmaster02.eqiad.wmflabs:/tmp/certificates/ ./modules/secret/secrets/certificates/

and commit the changes.  Note that this commits the private keys to this public repo.
This should be fine, as this repo is intended to be a dummy for testing puppet stuff in labs!
